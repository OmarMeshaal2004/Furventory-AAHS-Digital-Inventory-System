# Furventory-AAHS-Digital-Inventory-System

Created the foundational framework for “Furventory,” a digital inventory system for the Athens Area Humane Center, by outlining project scope, objectives, and high-level requirements 

Designed the initial database schema and defined data objects (e.g., pet food, supplies, expiration dates), plus drafted a barcode-scanning workflow using a free mobile app connected to the cloud  

Outlined how scanned items upload to an Excel spreadsheet in real-time to track donations and supplies, highlighted anticipated storage‐space constraints, and recommended possible expansion options (e.g., shipping container, property expansion)
